1.

Write several private variables and methods inside Employee. Be creative!
Make sure to incorporate the methods and variables as well (actually use them)

2.

Create a static 'uniform' String in the Store class for the uniform that the employees should
be wearing. 
Write a method inside the Employee class that prints out the following:
<cashier name> " is wearing " <uniform>
Note: The static variable should be public, so that it can be accessed elsewhere.

3.

Make the uniform variable final.
Read over final class notes again.
