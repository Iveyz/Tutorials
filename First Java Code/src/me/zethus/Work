File management

#1.

Prompt the user for 4 lines of data,
and write it to a file with the name of their choosing,
to the desktop. (hint: declaring the file using the string will require concatenation)

#2.

Read from a file on the desktop called data.txt, which contains 10 sentences on separate lines
Store all the lines in an array, and print out all of them in alphabetical order
by the first letter of each line.

#3.

Prompt the user for a file name, and if the file already exists on the desktop, notify them,
and tell them to choose another file name.
Otherwise, ask them what they want written to this new file. After that, they must be able to
ALTER what is in the file. As in, before the program closes you should print back to them
what was written to file, and ask them if they want something else written to the file instead.

(Hint: you will need to make use of the file.delete() method)
