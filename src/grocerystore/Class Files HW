Create a Cashier class with the following class members:

Name
Age
Years worked

The class constructor should demand arguments for name and age,
and when the constructor is called, the years worked member should be set to 0.

There should be methods to set and get the name/age, a method to increment the years worked by 1,
and a method to get the years worked. Make sure you test out the methods and whatnot in the main class like I did
with the Fruit

thats pretty well it i cant really give you 'bonus' shit on this
sure
it can be a bit tricky to get going
i'll give myself access to the git too so i can track your progress
do you have a Github account? ok
